# Dropdown

Make a simple navigation dropdown menu with the following levels:

```
- Home
- Portfolio
    - Amazing project
    - Not quite as amazing project
    - OMG it's so beautiful
- Photography
    - Cats
    - Kittens
    - More cats
- Contact me
```

Or words to that effect.

Build the html markup and the css from scratch and use JavaScript to open the
dropdown menus when you hover over the navigation elements.

**Tip:** use [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to help with creating dynamic elements.

**Points given for:**

* Functionality
* Clean html markup
* Easy to understand and extensible JavaScript

**N.B.** I've added a skeleton `index.html`, `css/styles.css` and `js/script.js` to get you
started. I've also added jQuery and [normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to the page to help out.
